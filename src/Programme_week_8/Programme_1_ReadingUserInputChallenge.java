/**
 * Read 10 numbers from the console entered by the user and print the sum of those
 * numbers.
 * -Use the hasNextInt() method from the scanner to check if the user has entered an int value.
 * -If hasNextInt() returns false, print the message Invalid Number. Continue reading until you have read
 * 10 numbers.
 * -Use the nextInt() method to get the number and add it to the sum.
 * -Before the user enters each number, print the message Enter number #x: where x represents the
 * count, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
 * -For example, the first message printed to the user would be Enter number #1:, the next Enter number
 * #2:, and so on.
 * Hint:
 * -Use a while loop.
 * -Use a counter variable for counting valid numbers.
 * -Close the scanner after you don't need it anymore.
 * -Create a class with the name ReadingUserInputChallenge
